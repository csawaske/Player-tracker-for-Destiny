# Player-tracker-for-Destiny
These files provide tools and documentation for obtaining a list of players encountered in the video game Destiny

There are three stages to the process:
1. Obtain a list of all players participating in all matches through Bungie's API
2. Put player names and the number of times encountered into a hash map
3. Sort the hashmap according to the number of times encountered
